* Write name beside whatever documentation you’re tackling here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/17Sg0yM0ltbBqXXycuoNFBVi6X5LnptppMWRkJBNCgNg/edit#

* Kirsta reviewing list for 7.4 against existing documentation overview in that google document to see if we are missing any major sections relating to new tools

* Decided to send documentation survey out in November to get results for December, after next release. Reason: release documentation will be an improvement and may change people’s minds about the wiki documentation.
